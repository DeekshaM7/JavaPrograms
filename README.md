# JavaPrograms

Assignment 1

Part1: Implement a menu-driven Java program (like fib or factorial) to implement these input methods
in java (command line args, Scanner, BufferedReader, DataInputStream, Console )
Part2: Implement a simple menu driven calculator in java to implement add, sub, mul, div, sqrt, power,
mean, variance. Implement a separate Calculator class to include all related function inside that class.
(mean calculation : program reads numbers from the keyboard, summing them in the process until the
user enters the string "end". It then stops input & displays the avg. of numbers)

Assignment 2

Part 1: Write a Java program that declares two arrays named 'even' and 'odd'. Accept numbers from the
user and move them to respective arrays depending on whether they are even or odd.
Part 2: Implement a Java function that finds two neighbouring numbers in an array with the smallest
distance to each. The function should return the index of the 1st number.
Part 3: Write a Java program to convert an array into ArrayList and vice versa.

Assignment 3

Write a menu-driven Java Program to study the concepts of classes, and array
of objects/arraylist, instance members, and constructors in Java.
Assignment description: Create a Student class describing attributes of a
student like prn, name, DoB, marks etc. Create an array of objects of
Student class and perform operations like Add students, Display, Search.
(by prn, by name, by position), Update/Edit and Delete.
